## Website Issues (16-21/3/22)

### Broken Cape 
1. Direct the user to open an OptiFine support ticket (Discord channel: `<#904875214112956497>`). Only sp614x can fix this issue. 

#### Causes
- The user moved their cape to another Minecraft username 
- The user changed their Minecarft username, causing the cape to be moved automatically 
- The user donated and got the cape after the website began having issues

#### Notes
- Most ways capes could be broken have now been blocked and redirect to [https://optifine.net/down](https://optifine.net/down). Chanaging Minecraft username may still break the cape.
- Because only sp614x can fix this and the large number of broken capes, getting them fixed may take a significant amount of time. 
- If the user doesn't see their cape's image (example below) when they are [signed in](https://optifine.net/login), the cape is broken. If the user *can* see the image of their cape, that doesn't necessarily mean it's working.

- While changing the cape design doesn't seem to cause this, it's not reccomended.
