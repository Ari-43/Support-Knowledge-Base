# Temporary Issues 
Issues that will (hopefully) not be around for long. 

## 1.19 Prerelease 1-2: Crashing 
The first solutions should be tried first 

- Set `Options... -> Video Settings... -> Quality... -> Connected Textures` to `OFF`
- Disable resource packs. If the resource packs menu is inaccessible, remove all resource packs from the `.minecraft/resourcepacks` folder
- Reset video settings using the button at `Options... -> Video Settings... -> Other... -> Reset Video Settings...`

## 1.19 Prerelease 1-2: Max Framerate Stuck on VSync 
- Reset Video Settings
