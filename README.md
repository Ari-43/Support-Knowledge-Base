# Support-Knowledge-Base

***I will not be providing OptiFine support in issues posted in the repository. If you need OptiFine support, join the [OptiFine Discord server](https://discord.gg/3mMpcwW) and ask in [#support-:fire:](https://discord.gg/P5xS9UfM)***  

- Ari43's modifications to the OptiFine support knowledge base. I am no longer providing OptiFine support, so this is (mostly) unmaintained. 
- Contains information from [the original Support Knowlage Base](https://github.com/Team-OptiFine/Support-Knowledge-Base)
- "User" usually refers to the user I'm helping and "username" is the Minecraft username, unless otherwise specified.
